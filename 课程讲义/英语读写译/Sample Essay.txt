Many student trapped a quesetion in university that social skills and academic qualifications which one more improtant for furture of people. In my view, the social skills is the important. Somebody maybe say: Do you have any evidence to support this statement. Off course, the answer is obvious. Because it's asocailly supreme society in our world.
To begin with. Most knowlegdge obtained at school are not used in work. Include Calculus, Literature, Geometry, Biology, Geographt and so on.This knowledge cannot help you find a job.Perhaps one say: if you present look for a job, Education is the ticket. Yes, Education is the ticket, but do you think only have a ticket enough for get a job? No way.moreover, Qualifications is just the one form of admission ticket. If you have a good social relationships with many people.Friends, teachers or relatives maybe help you get more ticket,your social skills to make this possible. In addition ,Social skills bring people closer togeter, it make your coworkers and boss freindlly, it's extremely vital to forward your career. Such as cooperation among colleagues or the boss's appreciation. So, Will academic qualifications be able to do that?
The moment, whether you're pretty sure the Education is not important.I don't think so. People's first social class was at school in our life. The time with your classmates spent maybe more than your parsents costs. Class is a small society, you can learn primary social skills and acquirung relationships from shcool. Also note that senior relationships obtained often comes from higher education. Secondly. Industry giants tend to favor highly educated people. It's a fact. If you want a offer from tops when you finish school, usually requires an excellent degree. It's trully too.
In conclusion,social skills and academic qualifications both important for our career. Comparison between the two, I prefer the former.
